        We were taught how to use different functions to write our blog post about what we learned. 
        I learned that using statements in our code is important because they help us become better programmers. 
        I also learned about basic attributes, which help with understanding how to write structured HTML. 
        Had a lot of fun learning about these different functions.

        Learned how to apply more advanced styles here. Many of the styles focused on font sizes and other
        design improvements. This helped make our code more structured and visually appealing.
        It was a good step up in understanding CSS and how HTML and CSS work together.

        Today we learned how to make a simple multi-column design using HTML and CSS. 
        This took a lot of trial and error, mostly because of how everything had to be formatted correctly. 
        Overall, it taught how to make something like a chart layout effectively.
