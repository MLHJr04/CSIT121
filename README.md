      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>We were taught how to use the different functions being used in able to write our blog post about what we learned. What I've learned in class today is that we have to use statements in our code, which is important because using statements in our code elevates our usage of becoming programmers. I also learned about basic attributes, which helps us with basic knowledgeinhow to write Had a lot of fun learning about these different functions</p>

    <h1>Gif Depiction</h1>

    <p>The Gif descripted shows flint lockwood being shocked/surprised, I chose this because it depicts him in a more funny and lighthearted moment.
            GIFS are usually pictures that are moving rather than non-moving ones like PNG'S or JPGS. Source - Google

    <h1>Sunflower Relation</h1>

    <p>The JPG depicted here is a sunflower behind a blue sky. I chose this because it feels happy and I enjoy sunflowers. JPGs typically don&rsquo;t move like PNGs, and they usually include backgrounds unlike PNGs.</p>

  <h1>HTML Related</h1>

  <p>The PNG depicted is a sheep. I chose this because I enjoy sheep a lot and think they're pretty cute. Now, PNGs don’t have backgrounds unlike JPGs, so you’re inclined to find differences if you want more than just the object you’re looking for online.</p>
