      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>We were taught how to use the different functions being used in able to write our blog post about what we learned. What I've learned in class today is that we have to use statements in our code, which is important because using statements in our code elevates our usage of becoming programmers. I also learned about basic attributes, which helps us with basic knowledgeinhow to write Had a lot of fun learning about these different functions</p>
